Poi TODO
========

Items marked with ** are show-stoppers for next release 

Within [brackets] is the person who came up with this todo and the
date that the item was added to this list.


Cleanup of old code
-------------------

- Move all Extensions/AppInstall.py code into GS handlers.
  [maurits, 2009-05-20]

- Remove code for PoiResponses.  We may want to keep the PoiResponse
  class around for migrations though.
  [maurits, 2009-05-20]

- Remove ancient migration code.
  [maurits, 2009-05-20]

- Replace python scripts in skin layer with browser views or other
  more modern code.

Possible features for inclusion:
--------------------------------

o Link Areas and Plone groups. This way, all UI postings should fire
    a mail to the UI team, for example.
    - Can do this with column in availableAreas grid, but need better
        management of who can do this, or we'll get every project on
        plone.org sending emails to every random team. :)
    - Perhaps we therefore need to be a bit more discriminating with the
        manager role

o Only install PoiPscTracker when PSC is detected (may be difficult with
    current ArchGenXML)

o Optional (!) ATSchemaEditorNG integration to get a set of variable
    fields on a per-use-case basis (need to retain standard fields
    always; only if it can be done cleanly and with little/no performance
    overhead)

o XML import/export of issues
    - Should look at PCNG's export format in particular
    - Would like to use xmlio if possible
    - Should allow partial updates, e.g. change issue, add new issue,
        over XML

Fixes:
------

Bugs/Known issues:

    o _renameAfterCreation() counter is not thread safe

Security issues:

    o Add max-size validator on uploaded attachments?

User interface:

    o Issues-by-tag UI on tracker front page needs more thinking
        - Need a quick and easy way to find issues by tag
        - Need a quick and easy way to add tags to issues
    
    o Consider threaded responses (maybe not by default)

    o Enable quoting other responses/issue text in responses
        - May be able to plug into Ploneboard?
        
    o The edit tab on issues is becoming very long. Consider re-organising
        it.

    o Would be nice to link to releases when in PSC view

    o No way to specify sort order in issue search form, and no sensible
        way of sorting by severity

    o Want to have sortable tables, but they look funny without nosort if
        the title makes a row two lines long or more
        
Tests:

    o Functional tests for standard operations

    o Should increase unit test coverage
        - Tests for tracker and issue states (permissions)
        - Vocab + defaults methods
